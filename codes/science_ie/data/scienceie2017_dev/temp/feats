Localised distributions and criteria for correctness in complex Langevin dynamics
Complex Langevin dynamics can solve the sign problem appearing in numerical simulations of theories with a complex action. In order to justify the procedure, it is important to understand the properties of the real and positive distribution, which is effectively sampled during the stochastic process. In the context of a simple model, we study this distribution by solving the Fokker–Planck equation as well as by brute force and relate the results to the recently derived criteria for correctness. We demonstrate analytically that it is possible that the distribution has support in a strip in the complexified configuration space only, in which case correct results are expected.


Exact solution of the van der Waals model in the critical region
The celebrated van der Waals model describes simple fluids in the thermodynamic limit and predicts the existence of a critical point associated to the gas–liquid phase transition. However the behavior of critical isotherms according to the equation of state, where a gas–liquid phase transition occurs, significantly departs from experimental observations. The correct critical isotherms are heuristically re-established via the Maxwell equal areas rule. A long standing open problem in mean field theory is concerned with the analytic description of van der Waals isotherms for a finite size system that is consistent, in the thermodynamic limit, with the Maxwell prescription. Inspired by the theory of nonlinear conservation laws, we propose a novel mean field approach, based on statistical mechanics, that allows to calculate the van der Waals partition function for a system of large but finite number of particles N. Our partition function naturally extends to the whole space of thermodynamic variables, reproduces, in the thermodynamic limit N→∞, the classical results outside the critical region and automatically encodes Maxwell’s prescription. We show that isothermal curves evolve in the space of thermodynamic variables like nonlinear breaking waves and the criticality is explained as the mechanism of formation of a classical hydrodynamic shock.


Molecular structure-property correlations from optical nonlinearity and thermal-relaxation dynamics
We apply ultrafast single beam Z-scan technique to measure saturation absorption coefficients and nonlinear-refraction coefficients of primary alcohols at 1560nm. The nonlinear effects result from vibronic transitions and cubic nonlinear-refraction. To measure the pure total third-order nonlinear susceptibility, we removed thermal effects with a frequency optimized optical-chopper. Our measurements of thermal-relaxation dynamics of alcohols, from 1560nm thermal lens pump and 780nm probe experiments revealed faster and slower thermal-relaxation timescales, respectively, from conduction and convection. The faster timescale accurately predicts thermal-diffusivity, which decreases linearly with alcohol chain-lengths since thermal-relaxation is slower in heavier molecules. The relation between thermal-diffusivity and alcohol chain-length confirms structure-property relationship.


Optical switching of radical pair conformation enhances magnetic sensitivity
The yield of radical pair reactions is influenced by magnetic fields well beyond the levels expected from energy considerations. This dependence can be traced back to the microscopic dynamics of electron spins and constitutes the basis of chemical compasses. Here we propose a new experimental approach based on molecular photoswitches to achieve additional control on the chemical reaction and allow short-time resolution of the spin dynamics. Our proposal enables experiments to test some of the standard assumptions of the radical pair model and improves the sensitivity of a paradigmatic model of chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude.


Static and dynamic modifications to photon absorption: The effects of surrounding chromophores
This Letter investigates the influence, on the molecular absorption of light, of surrounding chromophores. Two novel rate contributions are identified – one vanishing for a medium with no static dipole moment. The other, dynamic term is used to model a system of primary absorbers and secondary chromophores distributed in a host medium. Further modification provides a basis for modelling a case where the medium is, itself, marginally absorptive, thus accounting for optical losses as the input propagates through the surrounding host. The results facilitate tailoring of secondary chromophore and host effects in the pursuit of materials with specific absorption features.


Signatures of material and optical chirality: Origins and measures
Chirality in materials and light is of abiding interest across a broad range of scientific disciplines. This article discusses present and emerging issues in relation to molecular and optical chirality, also including some important developments in chiral metamaterials. Quantifying the chirality of matter or light leads to issues concerning the most appropriate measures, such as a helicity parameter for specific chiral chromophores and technical measures of light chirality. An optical helicity and chirality density depend on a difference between the numbers of left- and right-handed photons in a beam. In connection with circularly polarised luminescence, adoption of the Stokes parameter to spontaneous emission from chiral molecules invites critical attention. Modern spectroscopic techniques are often based on the different response arising from left-handed circularly polarised light compared to right-handed light. This dissimilarity can be exploited as a foundation for the separation of chiral molecules, promising new avenues of application.


Benchmark calculation for tunnelling through a multidimensional asymmetric double well potential
A benchmark calculation is presented for the quantum dynamics of tunnelling through a multidimensional asymmetric double well potential. A model Hamiltonian is used with a 1-dimensional tunnelling mode coupled to an (M−1)-dimensional harmonic bath, a system-bath problem. The benchmark calculation uses a basis set expansion of the wavefunction, with separate basis functions for the system and bath. Indistinguishability of configurations is exploited to greatly reduce the expense of the calculation, and a fully converged result is achieved. Comparison is offered to existing quantum dynamical methods that have tested this model problem, and further benchmark results not previously studied are presented.


An alternative to the use of a zero resistance ammeter for electrochemical noise measurement: Theoretical analysis, experimental validation and evaluation of electrode asymmetry
The measurement of current and potential noise during corrosion generally requires two electrodes, coupled by a zero resistance ammeter (ZRA), and a reference electrode. Statistical methods then enable estimation of the noise resistance, if the electrodes are identical. In this work, a resistor is used instead of a ZRA and, consequently, the electrodes potentials are partially decoupled. This enables evaluation of electrode asymmetry and the reliability of the estimated noise resistance. Additionally, the simplification of the current-measuring circuit ensures that no instrumental noise due to active electronic components within the ZRA is fed back to the corroding electrodes.


Application of corrosion inhibitors for steels in acidic media for the oil and gas industry: A review
This review summarizes the corrosion inhibition of steel materials in acidic media. Numerous corrosion inhibitors for steels in acidic solutions are presented. The emphasis is on HCl solutions, lower-grade steels, and elevated temperatures. This review is also devoted to corrosion inhibitor formulation design – mixtures of corrosion inhibitors with (mainly) surfactants, solvents, and intensifiers to improve the effectiveness of individual compounds at elevated temperatures. The information presented in this review is useful for diverse industrial fields, primarily for the well acidizing procedure, and secondly for other applications where corrosion inhibitors for steel materials are needed.


SKPFM measured Volta potential correlated with strain localisation in microstructure to understand corrosion susceptibility of cold-rolled grade 2205 duplex stainless steel
Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) of annealed and cold-rolled grade 2205 duplex stainless steel has been correlated with microstructure analysis using electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). In annealed microstructure Volta potential differences indicated micro-galvanic coupling between ferrite and austenite reasoning selective dissolution of ferrite. The introduction of cold work reduced the difference between both phases, but the development of local extremes in Volta potential was observed. Microstructure analysis revealed the presence of larger misorientation concentrations at these sites, which can explain the changes in observed corrosion behaviour, from selective dissolution in the annealed condition to localised corrosion attack after cold-rolling.


SAFT-γ force field for the simulation of molecular fluids 6: Binary and ternary mixtures comprising water, carbon dioxide, and n-alkanes
The SAFT-γ coarse graining methodology (Avendaño et al., 2011) is used to develop force fields for the fluid-phase behaviour of binary and ternary mixtures comprising water, carbon dioxide, and n-alkanes. The effective intermolecular interactions between the coarse grained (CG) segments are directly related to macroscopic thermodynamic properties by means of the SAFT-γ equation of state for molecular segments represented with the Mie (generalised Lennard–Jones) intermolecular potential (Papaioannou et al., 2014). The unlike attractive interactions between the components of the mixtures are represented with a single adjustable parameter, which is shown to be transferable over a wide range of conditions. The SAFT-γ Mie CG force fields are used in molecular-dynamics simulations to predict the challenging (vapour+liquid) and (liquid+liquid) fluid-phase equilibria characterising these mixtures, and to study phenomena that are not accessible directly from the equation of state, such as the interfacial properties. The description of the fluid-phase equilibria and interfacial properties predicted with the SAFT-γ Mie force fields is in excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental data, and of comparable if not superior quality to that reported for the more sophisticated atomistic and united-atom models.


A numerical modelling of gas exchange mechanisms between air and turbulent water with an aquarium chemical reaction
This paper proposes a new numerical modelling to examine environmental chemodynamics of a gaseous material exchanged between the air and turbulent water phases across a gas–liquid interface, followed by an aquarium chemical reaction. This study uses an extended concept of a two-compartment model, and assumes two physicochemical substeps to approximate the gas exchange processes. The first substep is the gas–liquid equilibrium between the air and water phases, A(g)⇌A(aq), with Henryʼs law constant H. The second is a first-order irreversible chemical reaction in turbulent water, A(aq)+H2O→B(aq)+H+ with a chemical reaction rate κA. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique has been employed to obtain details of the gas exchange mechanisms and the chemical reaction in the water compartment, while zero velocity and uniform concentration of A is considered in the air compartment. The study uses the different Schmidt numbers between 1 and 8, and six nondimensional chemical reaction rates between 10−∞(≈0) to 101 at a fixed Reynolds number. It focuses on the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on fundamental mechanisms of the gas exchange processes across the interface.


Kelvin wave propagation along straight boundaries in C-grid finite-difference models
Discrete solutions for the propagation of coastally-trapped Kelvin waves are studied, using a second-order finite-difference staggered grid formulation that is widely used in geophysical fluid dynamics (the Arakawa C-grid). The fundamental problem of linear, inviscid wave propagation along a straight coastline is examined, in a fluid of constant depth with uniform background rotation, using the shallow-water equations which model either barotropic (surface) or baroclinic (internal) Kelvin waves. When the coast is aligned with the grid, it is shown analytically that the Kelvin wave speed and horizontal structure are recovered to second-order in grid spacing h. When the coast is aligned at 45° to the grid, with the coastline approximated as a staircase following the grid, it is shown analytically that the wave speed is only recovered to first-order in h, and that the horizontal structure of the wave is infected by a thin computational boundary layer at the coastline. It is shown numerically that such first-order convergence in h is attained for all other orientations of the grid and coastline, even when the two are almost aligned so that only occasional steps are present in the numerical coastline. Such first-order convergence, despite the second-order finite differences used in the ocean interior, could degrade the accuracy of numerical simulations of dynamical phenomena in which Kelvin waves play an important role. The degradation is shown to be particularly severe for a simple example of near-resonantly forced Kelvin waves in a channel, when the energy of the forced response can be incorrect by a factor of 2 or more, even with 25 grid points per wavelength.


Numerical time-step restrictions as a result of capillary waves
The propagation of capillary waves on material interfaces between two fluids imposes a strict constraint on the numerical time-step applied to solve the equations governing this problem and is directly associated with the stability of interfacial flow simulations. The explicit implementation of surface tension is the generally accepted reason for the restrictions on the temporal resolution caused by capillary waves. In this article, a fully-coupled numerical framework with an implicit treatment of surface tension is proposed and applied, demonstrating that the capillary time-step constraint is in fact a constraint imposed by the temporal sampling of capillary waves, irrespective of the type of implementation. The presented results show that the capillary time-step constraint can be exceeded by several orders of magnitude, with the explicit as well as the implicit treatment of surface tension, if capillary waves are absent. Furthermore, a revised capillary time-step constraint is derived by studying the temporal resolution of capillary waves based on numerical stability and signal processing theory, including the Doppler shift caused by an underlying fluid motion. The revised capillary time-step constraint assures a robust, aliasing-free result, as demonstrated by representative numerical experiments, and is in the static case less restrictive than previously proposed time-step limits associated with capillary waves.


Whole cell tracking through the optimal control of geometric evolution laws
Cell tracking algorithms which automate and systematise the analysis of time lapse image data sets of cells are an indispensable tool in the modelling and understanding of cellular phenomena. In this study we present a theoretical framework and an algorithm for whole cell tracking. Within this work we consider that “tracking” is equivalent to a dynamic reconstruction of the whole cell data (morphologies) from static image data sets. The novelty of our work is that the tracking algorithm is driven by a model for the motion of the cell. This model may be regarded as a simplification of a recently developed physically meaningful model for cell motility. The resulting problem is the optimal control of a geometric evolution law and we discuss the formulation and numerical approximation of the optimal control problem. The overall goal of this work is to design a framework for cell tracking within which the recovered data reflects the physics of the forward model. A number of numerical simulations are presented that illustrate the applicability of our approach.


On variational and symplectic time integrators for Hamiltonian systems
Various systems in nature have a Hamiltonian structure and therefore accurate time integrators for those systems are of great practical use. In this paper, a finite element method will be explored to derive symplectic time stepping schemes for (non-)autonomous systems in a systematic way. The technique used is a variational discontinuous Galerkin finite element method in time. This approach provides a unified framework to derive known and new symplectic time integrators. An extended analysis for the new time integrators will be provided. The analysis shows that a novel third order time integrator presented in this paper has excellent dispersion properties. These new time stepping schemes are necessary to get accurate and stable simulations of (forced) water waves and other non-autonomous variational systems, which we illustrate in our numerical results.


Massively parallel kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of charge carrier transport in organic semiconductors
A parallel, lattice based Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation is developed that runs on a GPGPU board and includes Coulomb like particle–particle interactions. The performance of this computationally expensive problem is improved by modifying the interaction potential due to nearby particle moves, instead of fully recalculating it. This modification is achieved by adding dipole correction terms that represent the particle move. Exact evaluation of these terms is guaranteed by representing all interactions as 32-bit floating numbers, where only the integers between −222 and 222 are used. We validate our method by modelling the charge transport in disordered organic semiconductors, including Coulomb interactions between charges. Performance is mainly governed by the particle density in the simulation volume, and improves for increasing densities. Our method allows calculations on large volumes including particle–particle interactions, which is important in the field of organic semiconductors.


Mesh adaptation on the sphere using optimal transport and the numerical solution of a Monge–Ampère type equation
An equation of Monge–Ampère type has, for the first time, been solved numerically on the surface of the sphere in order to generate optimally transported (OT) meshes, equidistributed with respect to a monitor function. Optimal transport generates meshes that keep the same connectivity as the original mesh, making them suitable for r-adaptive simulations, in which the equations of motion can be solved in a moving frame of reference in order to avoid mapping the solution between old and new meshes and to avoid load balancing problems on parallel computers.The semi-implicit solution of the Monge–Ampère type equation involves a new linearisation of the Hessian term, and exponential maps are used to map from old to new meshes on the sphere. The determinant of the Hessian is evaluated as the change in volume between old and new mesh cells, rather than using numerical approximations to the gradients.OT meshes are generated to compare with centroidal Voronoi tessellations on the sphere and are found to have advantages and disadvantages; OT equidistribution is more accurate, the number of iterations to convergence is independent of the mesh size, face skewness is reduced and the connectivity does not change. However anisotropy is higher and the OT meshes are non-orthogonal.It is shown that optimal transport on the sphere leads to meshes that do not tangle. However, tangling can be introduced by numerical errors in calculating the gradient of the mesh potential. Methods for alleviating this problem are explored.Finally, OT meshes are generated using observed precipitation as a monitor function, in order to demonstrate the potential power of the technique.


Thermal treatment of simulant plutonium contaminated materials from the Sellafield site by vitrification in a blast-furnace slag
Four waste simulants, representative of Plutonium Contaminated Materials (PCMs) at the Sellafield site, were vitrified through additions of Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag (GGBS). Ce (as a Pu surrogate) was effectively partitioned into the slag product, enriched in an amorphous CaO–Fe2O3–Al2O3–SiO2 phase when other crystalline phases were also present. Ce L3 edge XANES data demonstrated Ce to be present as trivalent species in the slag fraction, irrespective of the waste type. Estimated volume reductions of ca. 80–95% were demonstrated, against a baseline of uncompacted 200L PCM waste drums. The dissolution behaviour of PCM slag wasteforms was investigated at 50°C in saturated Ca(OH)2 solution under N2 atmosphere, to simulate the hyperalkaline anoxic environment of a cementitious UK Geological Disposal Facility for Intermediate Level Waste (ILW). These experiments demonstrated the performance of the slag wasteforms to be comparable to that of other vitrified ILW materials considered potentially suitable for geological disposal.


Characterisation of nanosized oxides in ODM401 oxide dispersion strengthened steel
Changes to the microstructure of oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy ODM401 in response to high temperature heat treatments have been observed. Extensive analysis of thin foil and extraction replica specimens has been performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). A distribution of 2nm (mean diameter) particles, with a number density of 2×1023m−3, was observed in the extruded material. Following a heat treatment of 1h at 1300°C the number density of the dispersoids was diminished and their mean diameter increased to an average size of 5nm.High angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and chemically sensitive, high resolution, phase contrast, transmission electron microscopy has been used to positively identify nanometer scale pyrochlore oxides. Identification and a complete characterisation of the A2B2O7 structures, including the lattice positions of trivalent (A) and tetravalent (B) species is presented.The composition of the oxide particles was shown to be complex and the role of cations other than yttrium and titanium, in particular aluminium, must be considered in future analysis of the oxide phases and their nucleation and growth behaviour.The majority of the cube shaped oxide particles displayed one of two orientation relationships (OR) with the ferritic matrix. Cube on cube and the Baker and Nutting, cube edge on cube, relationships were identified.


A study into stress relaxation in oxides formed on zirconium alloys
Pressurised and boiling water reactors contain zirconium alloys, which are used as nuclear fuel cladding. Oxidation of these alloys, and the associated hydrogen pick-up, is a limiting factor in the lifetime of the fuel. To extend the burn-up of nuclear fuel requires control of the oxidation, and therefore development of a mechanistic understanding of the cladding corrosion process. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (S-XRD) has been used to analyse oxide layers formed during in-situ air oxidation of Zircaloy-4 and ZIRLO™. Analysis shows that as the oxide thickness increases over time there is a relaxation of the stresses present in both the monoclinic and meta-stable tetragonal phases, and a reduction in the tetragonal phase fraction. To better understand the mechanisms behind stress relaxation in the oxide layer, finite element analysis has been used to simulate mechanical aspects of the oxidation process. This simulation was first developed based on stress relaxation in oxides formed in autoclave, and analysed ex-situ using S-XRD. Relaxation mechanisms include creep and hydrogen-induced lattice strain in the metal substrate and creep in the oxide layer. Subsequently the finite element analysis has been extended to stress relaxation observed by in-situ S-XRD oxidation experiments. Finite element analysis indicates that the impact of creep in the oxide is negligible, and the impact of both creep and hydrogen-induced lattice strain in the metal substrate metal is small. The implication is that stress relaxation must result from another source such as the development of roughness at the metal–oxide interface, or fracture in the oxide layer.


The influence of glass composition on crystalline phase stability in glass-ceramic wasteforms
Zirconolite glass-ceramic wasteforms were prepared using a suite of Na2O–Al2O3–B2O3–SiO2 glass matrices with variable Al:B ratios. Zirconolite was the dominant crystalline phase only for the most alumina rich glass compositions. As the Al:B ratio decreased zirconolite was replaced by sphene, zircon and rutile. Thermodynamic data were used to calculate a silica activity in the glass melt below which zirconolite is the favoured crystalline phase. The concept of the crystalline reference state of glass melts is then utilised to provide a physical basis for why silica activity varies with the Al:B ratio.


Atomistic investigation of the structure and transport properties of tilt grain boundaries of UO2
We apply atomistic simulation techniques to address whether oxygen shows higher diffusivity at the grain boundary region compared to that in bulk UO2, and whether the relative diffusivity is affected by the choice of the grain boundary. We consider coincident site lattice grain boundaries, Σ3, Σ5, Σ9, Σ11 and Σ19, expressing the {nn1}, {n11}, and {n10} surfaces, and evaluate the extent that the grain boundary structures affect the diffusion of oxygen. We found that oxygen diffusion is enhanced at all boundaries and in the adjacent regions, with strong dependence on the temperature and local structure.


Zirconium hydride precipitation kinetics in Zircaloy-4 observed with synchrotron X-ray diffraction
High-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction was used to investigate the isothermal precipitation of δ-hydride platelets in Zircaloy-4 at a range of temperatures relevant to reactor conditions, during both normal operation and thermal transients. From an examination of the rate kinetics of the precipitation process, precipitation slows with increasing temperature above 200°C, due to a reduction in the thermodynamic driving force. A model for nucleation rate as a function of temperature was developed, to interpret the precipitation rates seen experimentally. While the strain energy associated with the misfit between hydrides and the matrix makes a significant contribution to the energy barrier for nucleation, a larger contribution arises from the interfacial energy. Diffusion distance calculations show that hydrogen is highly mobile in the considered thermal range and on the scale of inter-hydride spacing and it is not expected to be significantly rate limiting on the precipitation process that takes place under reactor operating conditions.


The UC2−x – Carbon eutectic: A laser heating study
The UC2−x – carbon eutectic has been studied by laser heating and fast multi-wavelength pyrometry under inert atmosphere.The study has been carried out on three compositions, two of which close to the phase boundary of the UC2−x – C miscibility gap (with C/U atomic ratios 2 and 2.1), and one, more crucial, with a large excess of carbon (C/U = 2.82). The first two compositions were synthesised by arc-melting. This synthesis method could not be applied to the last composition, which was therefore completed directly by laser irradiation. The U – C – O composition of the samples was checked by using a combustion method in an ELTRA® analyser. The eutectic temperature, established to be 2737 K ± 20 K, was used as a radiance reference together with the cubic – tetragonal (α → β) solid state transition, fixed at 2050 K ± 20 K. The normal spectral emissivity of the carbon-richer compounds increases up to 0.7, whereas the value 0.53 was established for pure hypostoichiometric uranium dicarbide at the limit of the eutectic region. This increase is analysed in the light of the demixing of excess carbon, and used for the determination of the liquidus temperature (3220 K ± 50 K for UC2.82). Due to fast solid state diffusion, also fostered by the cubic – tetragonal transition, no obvious signs of a lamellar eutectic structure could be observed after quenching to room temperature. The eutectic surface C/UC2−x composition could be qualitatively, but consistently, followed during the cooling process with the help of the recorded radiance spectra. Whereas the external liquid surface is almost entirely constituted by uranium dicarbide, it gets rapidly enriched in demixed carbon upon freezing. Demixed carbon seems to quickly migrate towards the inner bulk during further cooling. At the α → β transition, uranium dicarbide covers again the almost entire external surface.


Synthesis of carbon-13 labelled carbonaceous deposits and their evaluation for potential use as surrogates to better understand the behaviour of the carbon-14-containing deposit present in irradiated PGA graphite
The present work has used microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition to generate suitable isotopically labelled carbonaceous deposits on the surface of Pile Grade A graphite for use as surrogates for studying the behaviour of the deposits observed on irradiated graphite extracted from UK Magnox reactors. These deposits have been shown elsewhere to contain an enhanced concentration of 14C compared to the bulk graphite. A combination of Raman spectroscopy, ion beam milling with scanning electron microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry were used to determine topography and internal morphology in the formed deposits. Direct comparison was made against deposits found on irradiated graphite samples trepanned from a Magnox reactor core and showed a good similarity in appearance. This work suggests that the microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition technique is of value in producing simulant carbon deposits, being of sufficiently representative morphology for use in non-radioactive surrogate studies of post-disposal behaviour of 14C-containing deposits on some irradiated Magnox reactor graphite.


Analysis of implicit and explicit lattice sensitivities using DRAGON
Deterministic lattice physics transport calculations are used extensively within the context of operational and safety analysis of nuclear power plants. As such the sensitivity and uncertainty in the evaluated nuclear data used to predict neutronic interactions and other key transport phenomena are critical topics for research. Sensitivity analysis of nuclear systems with respect to fundamental nuclear data using multi-energy-group discretization is complicated by the dilution dependency of multi-group macroscopic cross-sections as a result of resonance self-shielding. It has become common to group sensitivities into implicit and explicit effects to aid in the understanding of the nature of the sensitivities involved in the calculations, however the overall sensitivity is an integral of these effects. Explicit effects stem from perturbations performed for a specific nuclear data for a given isotope and at a specific energy, and their direct impact on the end figure of merit. Implicit effects stem from resonance self-shielding effects and can change the nature of their own sensitivities at other energies, or that for other reactions or even other isotopes. Quantification of the implicit sensitivity component involves some manner of treatment of resonance parameters in a way that is self-consistent with perturbations occurring in associated multi-group cross-sections. A procedure for assessing these implicit effects is described in the context of the Bondarenko method of self-shielding and implemented using a WIMS-D4 multi-group nuclear library and the lattice solver DRAGON. The resulting sensitivity results were compared to those calculated by TSUNAMI-1D, which computes implicit sensitivities using a different methodology consisting of a combination of linear perturbation theory and automatic differentiation. Energy-dependent sensitivity profiles and integrated sensitivity coefficients are presented, as well as a comparison of calculated sensitivities for different energy group structures and geometry dimensionalities.


Analysis of events related to cracks and leaks in the reactor coolant pressure boundary
The presence of cracks and leaks in the reactor coolant pressure boundary may jeopardise the safe operation of nuclear power plants. Analysis of cracks and leaks related events is an important task for the prevention of their recurrence, which should be performed in the context of activities on Operating Experience Feedback. In response to this concern, the EU Clearinghouse operated by the JRC-IET supports and develops technical and scientific work to disseminate the lessons learned from past operating experience. In particular, concerning cracks and leaks, the studies carried out in collaboration with IRSN and GRS have allowed to identify the most sensitive areas to degradation in the plant primary system and to elaborate recommendations for upgrading the maintenance, ageing management and inspection programmes. An overview of the methodology used in the analysis of cracks and leaks related events is presented in this paper, together with the relevant results obtained in the study.


Direct normal irradiance related definitions and applications: The circumsolar issue
The direct irradiance received on a plane normal to the sun, called direct normal irradiance (DNI), is of particular relevance to concentrated solar technologies, including concentrating solar thermal plants and concentrated photovoltaic systems. Following various standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the DNI definition is related to the irradiance from a small solid angle of the sky, centered on the position of the sun. Half-angle apertures of pyrheliometers measuring DNI have varied over time, up to ≈10°. The current recommendation of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for this half-angle is 2.5°. Solar concentrating collectors have an angular acceptance function that can be significantly narrower, especially for technologies with high concentration ratios. The disagreement between the various interpretations of DNI, from the theoretical definition used in atmospheric physics and radiative transfer modeling to practical definitions corresponding to specific measurements or conversion technologies is significant, especially in the presence of cirrus clouds or large concentration of aerosols. Under such sky conditions, the circumsolar radiation—i.e. the diffuse radiation coming from the vicinity of the sun—contributes significantly to the DNI ground measurement, although some concentrating collectors cannot utilize the bulk of it. These issues have been identified in the EU-funded projects MACC-II (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate-Interim Implementation) and SFERA (Solar Facilities for the European Research Area), and have been discussed within a panel of international experts in the framework of the Solar Heating and Cooling (SHC) program of the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) Task 46 “Solar Resource Assessment and Forecasting”. In accordance with these discussions, the terms of reference related to DNI are specified here. The important role of circumsolar radiation is evidenced, and its potential contribution is evaluated for typical atmospheric conditions. For thorough analysis of performance of concentrating solar systems, it is recommended that, in addition to the conventional DNI related to 2.5° half-angle of today’s pyrheliometers, solar resource data sets also report the sunshape, the circumsolar contribution or the circumsolar ratio (CSR).


Stochastic generation of synthetic minutely irradiance time series derived from mean hourly weather observation data
Synthetic minutely irradiance time series are utilised in non-spatial solar energy system research simulations. It is necessary that they accurately capture irradiance fluctuations and variability inherent in the solar resource. This article describes a methodology to generate a synthetic minutely irradiance time series from widely available hourly weather observation data. The weather observation data are used to produce a set of Markov chains taking into account seasonal, diurnal, and pressure influences on transition probabilities of cloud cover. Cloud dynamics are based on a power-law probability distribution, from which cloud length and duration are derived. Atmospheric transmission losses are simulated with minutely variability, using atmospheric profiles from meteorological reanalysis data and cloud attenuation derived real-world observations. Both direct and diffuse irradiance are calculated, from which total irradiance is determined on an arbitrary plane. The method is applied to the city of Leeds, UK, and validated using independent hourly radiation measurements from the same site. Variability and ramp rate are validated using 1-min resolution irradiance data from the town of Cambourne, Cornwall, UK. The hourly irradiance frequency distribution correlates with R2=0.996 whilst the mean hourly irradiance correlates with R2=0.971, the daily variability indices cumulative probability distribution function (CDF), 1-min irradiance ramp rate CDF and 1-min irradiance frequency CDF are also shown to correlate with R2=0.9903,1.000, and 0.9994 respectively. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on 1-min data for each day show that the ramp rate frequency of occurrence is captured with a high significance level of 99.99%, whilst the irradiance frequency distribution and minutely variability indices are captured at significances of 99% and 97.5% respectively. The use of multiple Markov chains and detailed consideration of the atmospheric losses are shown to be essential elements for the generation of realistic minutely irradiance time series over a typical meteorological year. A freely downloadable example of the model is made available and may be configured to the particular requirements of users or incorporated into other models.


Electrical-thermal analysis of III–V triple-junction solar cells under variable spectra and ambient temperatures
The influence of the incident spectral irradiance on the electrical and thermal behaviour of triple-junction solar cells has been investigated. A spectral dependent electrical model has been developed to calculate the electric characteristics and quantify the heat power of a multijunction solar cell. A three-dimensional finite element analysis is also used to predict the solar cell’s operating temperature and cooling requirements for a range of ambient temperatures. The combination of these models improves the prediction accuracy of the electrical and thermal behaviour of triple-junction solar cells. The convective heat transfer coefficient between the back-plate and ambient air was found to be the significant parameter in achieving high electrical efficiency. These data are important for the electrical and thermal optimisation of concentrating photovoltaic systems under real conditions. The objective of this work is to quantify the temperature and cooling requirements of multijunction solar cells under variable solar spectra and ambient temperatures. It is shown that single cell configurations with a solar cell area of 1cm2 can be cooled passively for concentration ratios of up to 500× with a heat sink thermal resistance below 1.63K/W, however for high ambient temperatures (greater than 40°C), a thermal resistance less than 1.4K/W is needed to keep the solar cell operating within safe operating conditions.


Bayesian calibration of the constants of the k–ε turbulence model for a CFD model of street canyon flow
In this paper we carry out a Bayesian calibration for uncertainty analysis in Computational Fluid Dynamics modelling of urban flows. Taking the case of airflow in a regular street canyon, and choosing turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) as our quantity of interest, we calibrate 3-D CFD simulations against wind tunnel observations. We focus our calibration on the model constants contained within the standard RANS k–ε turbulence model and the uncertainties relating to these values. Thus we are able to narrow down the space of k–ε model constants which provide the best match with experimental data and quantify the uncertainty relating to both the k–ε model constants in the case of street canyon flow and the TKE outputs of the CFD simulation. Furthermore, we are able to construct a statistical emulator of the CFD model. Finally, we provide predictions of TKE based on the emulator and the estimated bias between model and observations, accompanied with uncertainties in these predictions.


Comparison and calibration of a real-time virtual stenting algorithm using Finite Element Analysis and Genetic Algorithms
In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis between two computational methods for virtual stent deployment: a novel fast virtual stenting method, which is based on a spring–mass model, is compared with detailed finite element analysis in a sequence of in silico experiments. Given the results of the initial comparison, we present a way to optimise the fast method by calibrating a set of parameters with the help of a genetic algorithm, which utilises the outcomes of the finite element analysis as a learning reference. As a result of the calibration phase, we were able to substantially reduce the force measure discrepancy between the two methods and validate the fast stenting method by assessing the differences in the final device configurations.


Graphene-based materials: Synthesis and gas sorption, storage and separation
Graphene-based materials have generated tremendous interest in a wide range of research activities. A wide variety of graphene related materials have been synthesised for potential applications in electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and gas sorption, storage, separation and sensing. Recently, gas sorption, storage and separation in porous nanocarbons and metal–organic frameworks have received increasing attention. In particular, the tuneable porosity, surface area and functionality of the lightweight and stable graphene-based materials open up great scope for those applications. Such structural features can be achieved by the design and control of the synthesis routes. Here, we highlight recent progresses and challenges in the syntheses of graphene-based materials with hierarchical pore structures, tuneable high surface area, chemical doping and surface functionalization for gas (H2, CH4, CO2, N2, NH3, NO2, H2S, SO2, etc.) sorption, storage and separation.


Perspectives on oblique angle deposition of thin films: From fundamentals to devices
The oblique angle configuration has emerged as an invaluable tool for the deposition of nanostructured thin films. This review develops an up to date description of its principles, including the atomistic mechanisms governing film growth and nanostructuration possibilities, as well as a comprehensive description of the applications benefiting from its incorporation in actual devices. In contrast with other reviews on the subject, the electron beam assisted evaporation technique is analyzed along with other methods operating at oblique angles, including, among others, magnetron sputtering and pulsed laser or ion beam-assisted deposition techniques. To account for the existing differences between deposition in vacuum or in the presence of a plasma, mechanistic simulations are critically revised, discussing well-established paradigms such as the tangent or cosine rules, and proposing new models that explain the growth of tilted porous nanostructures. In the second part, we present an extensive description of applications wherein oblique-angle-deposited thin films are of relevance. From there, we proceed by considering the requirements of a large number of functional devices in which these films are currently being utilized (e.g., solar cells, Li batteries, electrochromic glasses, biomaterials, sensors, etc.), and subsequently describe how and why these nanostructured materials meet with these needs.


Structure of micro-crack population and damage evolution in quasi-brittle media
Mechanical behaviour of quasi-brittle materials, such as concrete and rock, is controlled by the generation and growth of micro-cracks. A 3D lattice model is used in this work for generating micro-crack populations. In the model, lattice sites signify solid-phase blocks and lattice bonds transmit forces and moments between adjacent sites. Micro-cracks are generated at the interfaces between solid-phase blocks, where initial defects are allocated according to given size distribution. This is represented by removal of bonds when a criterion based on local forces and defect size is met. The growing population of micro-cracks results in a non-linear stress–strain response, which can be characterised by a standard damage parameter. This population is analysed using a graph-theoretical approach, where graph nodes represent failed faces and graph edges connect neighbouring failed faces, i.e. coalesced micro-cracks. The evolving structure of the graph components is presented and linked to the emergent non-linear behaviour and damage. The results provide new insights into the relation between the topological structure of the population of micro-cracks and the material macroscopic response. The study is focused on concrete, for which defect sizes were available, but the proposed methodology is applicable to a range of quasi-brittle materials with similar dominant damage mechanisms.


Room temperature ferromagnetism and half metallicity in nickel doped ZnS: Experimental and DFT studies
The nickel doped nanocrystalline ZnS thin films were deposited onto glass substrates by chemical bath deposition (CBD). Also ZnS:Ni nanoparticles were synthesized by CBD/co-precipitation method. Powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD) studies demonstrate that both thin films and nanoparticles correspond to sphalerite (cubic) phase of ZnS with slight shift towards higher 2θ values due to incorporation of nickel in the ZnS lattice. The crystallite sizes estimated by Scherrer equation were 4 and 2.6 nm for ZnNiS thin films and nanoparticles, respectively. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images reveal that the morphology of thin films is based on quasi-spherical particles with nano scale dimensions. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy confirms that the as-deposited thin films have a stoichiometry consistent with the nickel doped ZnS. Full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FP-L/APW) method based on spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of ZnNiS for the doping concentration. Exchange-correlation functional was studied using generalized gradient approximation (GGA + U) method. Electronic band structures and density of states (DOS) demonstrate 100% spin polarization (half metallicity) with ferromagnetic exchange interactions. Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) analysis confirms the theoretical observation of ferromagnetism in nickel doped ZnS. These ZnS based half metallic ferromagnets seem to have virtuous applications in future spintronic devices.


Control of laser induced molecular fragmentation of n-propyl benzene using chirped femtosecond laser pulses
We present the effect of chirping a femtosecond laser pulse on the fragmentation of n-propyl benzene. An enhancement of an order of magnitude for the relative yields of C3H3+ and C5H5+ in the case of negatively chirped pulses and C6H5+ in the case of positively chirped pulses with respect to the transform-limited pulse indicates that in some fragmentation channel, coherence of the laser field plays an important role. For the relative yield of all other heavier fragment ions, resulting from the interaction of the intense laser field with the molecule, there is no such enhancement effect with the sign of chirp, within experimental errors. The importance of the laser phase is further reinforced through a direct comparison of the fragmentation results with the second harmonic of the chirped laser pulse with identical bandwidth.


Assignment of the vibrational spectrum of l-cysteine
Ab initio calculations of the complete unit cell of l-cysteine for both the orthorhombic and monoclinic polymorphs have been carried out. The results suggest the presence of a previously unrecognised, weak dihydrogen bond of a novel type: S–H···N–H in the gauche conformer of the monoclinic polymorph. Comparison of the calculated transition energies to those observed in the infrared, Raman and inelastic neutron scattering spectra of the orthorhombic form shows excellent agreement, as does the simulated INS spectra to that experimentally measured. The assignments are in general agreement with those in the literature but differ in detail. The strong intermolecular interactions present make the use of periodic-DFT essential in order to correctly assign the spectra. The need for, and the complementarity of, all three types of vibrational spectra: infrared, Raman and INS is clearly demonstrated.


Inelastic neutron scattering study of binding of para-hydrogen in an ultra-microporous metal–organic framework
Metal–organic framework (MOF) materials show promise for H2 storage and it is widely predicted by computational modelling that MOFs incorporating ultra-micropores are optimal for H2 binding due to enhanced overlapping potentials. We report the investigation using inelastic neutron scattering of the interaction of H2 in an ultra-microporous MOF material showing low H2 uptake capacity. The study has revealed that adsorbed H2 at 5K has a liquid recoil motion along the channel with very little interaction with the MOF host, consistent with the observed low uptake. The low H2 uptake is not due to incomplete activation or decomposition as the desolvated MOF shows CO2 uptake with a measured pore volume close to that of the single crystal pore volume. This study represents a unique example of surprisingly low H2 uptake within a MOF material, and complements the wide range of studies on systems showing higher uptake capacities and binding interactions.


A classic case of Jahn–Teller effect theory revisited: Ab initio simulation of hyperfine coupling and pseudorotational tunneling in the 12E′ state of Na3
The predictive capabilities of current ab initio approaches are tested in a benchmark study on the well known case of the Na3 ground state. This molecule is small enough to be treated with computationally demanding methods, but also shows an interesting interplay between Jahn–Teller-, spin-orbit-, rovibrational- and hyperfine-interactions. The necessary parameters for the effective Hamiltonian are derived from the potential energy surface of the 12E′ ground state and from spin density evaluations at selected geometries, without any fitting adjustments to experimental data. We compare our results to highly resolved microwave spectra, with the aim to improve previous assignment attempts, where some parameters had to be estimated from fits to measured spectra.


Photocatalytic water splitting with acridine dyes: Guidelines from computational chemistry
The photocatalytic splitting of water into H and OH radicals in hydrogen-bonded chromophore-water complexes has been explored with computational methods for the chromophores acridine orange (AO) and benzacridine (BA). These dyes are strong absorbers within the range of the solar spectrum. It is shown that low-lying charge-transfer excited states exist in the hydrogen-bonded AOH2O and BAH2O complexes which drive the transfer of a proton from water to the chromophore, which results in AOHOH or BAHOH biradicals. The AOH and BAH radicals possess bright ππ∗ excited states with vertical excitation energies near 3.0eV which are predissociated by a low-lying repulsive πσ∗ state. The conical intersections of the πσ∗ state with the ππ∗ excited states and the ground state provide a mechanism for the photodetachment of the H-atom by a second photon. Our results indicate that AO and BA are promising chromophores for water splitting with visible light.


Large Eddy Simulations of turbulent particle-laden channel flow
This paper scrutinises the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach to simulate the behaviour of inter-acting particles in a turbulent channel flow. A series of simulations that are fully (four-way), two-way and one-way coupled are performed in order to investigate the importance of the individual physical phenomena occurring in particle-laden flows. Moreover, the soft sphere and hard sphere models, which describe the interaction between colliding particles, are compared with each other and the drawbacks and advantages of each algorithm are discussed. Different models to describe the sub-grid scale stresses with LES are compared. Finally, simulations accounting for the rough walls of the channel are compared to simulations with smooth walls. The results of the simulations are discussed with the aid of the experimental data of Kussin J. and Sommerfeld M., 2002, Experimental studies on particle behaviour and turbulence modification in horizontal channel flow with different wall roughness, Exp. in Fluids, 33, pp. 143–159 of Reynolds number 42,000 based on the full channel height. The simulations are carried out in a three-dimensional domain of 0.175m×0.035m ×0.035m where the direction of gravity is perpendicular to the flow. The simulation results demonstrate that rough walls and inter-particle collisions have an important effect in redistributing the particles across the channel, even for very dilute flows. A new roughness model is proposed which takes into account the fact that a collision in the soft sphere model is fully resolved and it is shown that the new model is in very good agreement with the available experimental data.


LES of turbulent liquid jet primary breakup in turbulent coaxial air flow
A robust two-phase flow Large Eddy Simulation (LES) algorithm has been developed and applied to predict the primary breakup of an axisymmetric water jet injected into a surrounding coaxial air flow. The high liquid/gas density and viscosity ratios are known to represent a significant challenge in numerical modelling of the primary breakup process. In the current LES methodology, an extrapolated liquid velocity field was used to minimise discretisation errors, whilst maintaining sharp treatment of fluid properties across the interface. The proposed numerical approach showed excellent robustness and high accuracy in predicting coaxial liquid jet primary breakup. Since strong turbulence structures will develop inside the injector at high Reynolds numbers and affect the subsequent primary breakup, the Rescaling and Recycling Method (R2M) was implemented to facilitate generation of appropriate unsteady LES inlet conditions for both phases. The influence of inflowing liquid and gas turbulent structures on the initial interface instability was investigated. It is shown that liquid turbulent eddies play the dominant role in the initial development of liquid jet surface disturbance and distortion for the flow conditions considered. When turbulent inflows were specified by the R2M technique, the predicted core breakup lengths at different air/water velocities agreed closely with experimental data.


Modelling of gas–solid turbulent channel flow with non-spherical particles with large Stokes numbers
This paper describes a complete framework to predict the behaviour of interacting non-spherical particles with large Stokes numbers in a turbulent flow. A summary of the rigid body dynamics of particles and particle collisions is presented in the framework of Quaternions. A particle-rough wall interaction model to describe the collisions between non-spherical particles and a rough wall is put forward as well. The framework is coupled with a DNS-LES approach to simulate the behaviour of horizontal turbulent channel flow with 5 differently shaped particles: a sphere, two types of ellipsoids, a disc, and a fibre. The drag and lift forces and the torque on the particles are computed from correlations which are derived using true DNS.The simulation results show that non-spherical particles tend to locally maximise the drag force, by aligning their longest axis perpendicular to the local flow direction. This phenomenon is further explained by performing resolved direct numerical simulations of an ellipsoid in a flow. These simulations show that the high pressure region on the acute sides of a non-spherical particle result in a torque if an axis of the non-spherical particle is not aligned with the flow. This torque is only zero if the axis of the particle is perpendicular to the local direction of the flow. Moreover, the particle is most stable when the longest axis is aligned perpendicular to the flow.The alignment of the longest axis of a non-spherical particle perpendicular to the local flow leads to non-spherical particles having a larger average velocity compared to spherical particles with the same equivalent diameter. It is also shown that disc-shaped particles flow in a more steady trajectory compared to elongated particles, such as elongated ellipsoids and fibres. This is related to the magnitude of the pressure gradient on the acute side of the non-spherical particles. Finally, it is shown that the effect of wall roughness affects non-spherical particles differently than spherical particles. Particularly, a collision of a non-spherical particle with a rough wall induces a significant amount of rotational energy, whereas a corresponding collision with a spherical particle results in mostly a change in translational motion.


Coarse grained force field for the molecular simulation of natural gases and condensates
The atomistically-detailed molecular modelling of petroleum fluids is challenging, amongst other aspects, due to the very diverse multicomponent and asymmetric nature of the mixtures in question. Complicating matters further, the time scales for many important processes can be much larger than the current and foreseeable capacity of modern computers running fully-atomistic models. To overcome these limitations, a coarse grained (CG) model is proposed where some of the less-important degrees of freedom are safely integrated out, leaving as key parameters the average energy levels, the molecular conformations and the range of the Mie intermolecular potentials employed as the basis of the model. The parametrization is performed by using an analytical equation of state of the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) family to link the potential parameters to macroscopically observed thermophysical properties. The parameters found through this top-down approach are used directly in molecular dynamics simulations of multi-component multi-phase systems. The procedure is exemplified by calculating the phase envelope of the methane–decane binary and of two synthetic light condensate mixtures. A methodology based on the discrete expansion of a mixture is used to determine the bubble points of these latter mixtures, with an excellent agreement to experimental data. The model presented is entirely predictive and an abridged table of parameters for some fluids of interest is provided.


Degradation science: Mesoscopic evolution and temporal analytics of photovoltaic energy materials
Based on recent advances in nanoscience, data science and the availability of massive real-world datastreams, the mesoscopic evolution of mesoscopic energy materials can now be more fully studied. The temporal evolution is vastly complex in time and length scales and is fundamentally challenging to scientific understanding of degradation mechanisms and pathways responsible for energy materials evolution over lifetime. We propose a paradigm shift towards mesoscopic evolution modeling, based on physical and statistical models, that would integrate laboratory studies and real-world massive datastreams into a stress/mechanism/response framework with predictive capabilities. These epidemiological studies encompass the variability in properties that affect performance of material ensembles. Mesoscopic evolution modeling is shown to encompass the heterogeneity of these materials and systems, and enables the discrimination of the fast dynamics of their functional use and the slow and/or rare events of their degradation. We delineate paths forward for degradation science.


Information impact on transportation systems
With a broader distribution of personal smart devices and with an increasing availability of advanced navigation tools, more drivers can have access to real time information regarding the traffic situation. Our research focuses on determining how using the real time information about a transportation system could influence the system itself. We developed an agent based model to simulate the effect of drivers using real time information to avoid traffic congestion. Experiments reveal that the system's performance is influenced by the number of participants that have access to real time information. We also discover that, in certain circumstances, the system performance when all participants have information is no different from, and perhaps even worse than, when no participant has access to information.


Chaospy: An open source tool for designing methods of uncertainty quantification
The paper describes the philosophy, design, functionality, and usage of the Python software toolbox Chaospy for performing uncertainty quantification via polynomial chaos expansions and Monte Carlo simulation. The paper compares Chaospy to similar packages and demonstrates a stronger focus on defining reusable software building blocks that can easily be assembled to construct new, tailored algorithms for uncertainty quantification. For example, a Chaospy user can in a few lines of high-level computer code define custom distributions, polynomials, integration rules, sampling schemes, and statistical metrics for uncertainty analysis. In addition, the software introduces some novel methodological advances, like a framework for computing Rosenblatt transformations and a new approach for creating polynomial chaos expansions with dependent stochastic variables.
