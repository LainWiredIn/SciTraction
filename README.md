| Automatic keyphrase extraction | [paper](papers/Automatic_keyphrase_extraction_An_overview_of_the_state_of_the_art.pdf) | [code](codes/KPE/) | It uses keras which is giving compilation error. I am trying to fix it. The codebase can be used as biolerplate for project | It uses GRU and RNN for keyphrase extraction. It uses keras. we can reproduce it using pytorch. We can also use its code for evaluation purpose |
| TTI COIN (LSTM ER | [paper](papers/TTICOiN.pdf) | [code](codes/LSTM_ER/) | Getting cnn source not given error and it's requirements time taking to install. | Its written in c++ and not compatible to run our systems. we can use the ideas of relation extraction and entity recognition from this code and reproduce it in pytorch. |
| WING-NUS at SemEval-2017 Task 10 | [paper](papers/WING-NUS.pdf)|[code](codes/science_ie/) | this code is for only for data parsing and paper does not have any full code github. | we can use it for parsing the input data and train test split. |
